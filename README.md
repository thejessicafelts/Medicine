## **Kaggle Lung Cancer Dataset** *[Under Construction]* <br/>
##### https://github.com/thejessicafelts/medicine__lung-cancer-dataset <br/>
Lung Cancer Dataset which provides a structured foundation for the development of cancer detection models. This dataset exemplifies the variety of symptoms of Lung Cancer. Each category within the dataset &mdash; `GENDER`, `AGE`, `SMOKING`, `YELLOW_FINGERS`, `ANXIETY`, `PEER_PRESSURE`, `CHRONIC_DISEASE`, `FATIGUE`, `ALLERGY`, `WHEEZING`, `ALCOHOL_CONSUMING`, `COUGHING`, `SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH`, `SWALLOWING_DIFFICULTY`, `CHEST_PAIN` &mdash; has been carefully curated to encompass a diverse range of symptoms, ensuring that the resulting models are versatile and accurate. This scientific approach not only enhances the dataset's diversity to record symptoms of lung cancer but also contributes to the broader field of AI-driven health technologies, pushing the boundaries of what health care assistants can achieve.
